# Awesome Text Summarization

A quick reference guide for anyone looking to dive into the world of text summarization. This guide outlines fundamental approaches, key methodologies, and available resources to help practitioners and researchers build effective summarization systems.

## Motivation
- **Information Overload**: Data is growing exponentially across industries (news, social media, etc.).
- **Goal**: Generate concise, informative, and potentially domain-specific summaries to save time and aid in understanding.

## Task Definition
- **Single/Multi-Document Summarization**: Summaries can be derived from one or multiple sources.
- **Query-Focused Summarization**: Summaries tailored to a user’s question or topic of interest.
- **Generic vs. Focused Summarization**:
  - **Generic**: Aims for a broad overview.
  - **Focused**: Addresses specific details or differences.

## Basic Approaches

### 1. Extractive Summarization
- **Graph-Based (e.g., TextRank)**: Uses graph structures (nodes = text units, edges = similarity) to rank sentence importance.
- **Feature-Based**: Scores sentences based on features (position, term frequency, named entity tags), then selects the top candidates.
- **Topic-Based**: Relies on topic modeling (LSA, LDA) to identify key thematic sentences.
- **Neural Models**: Uses deep learning (RNNs, transformers) to predict which sentences should appear in the summary.

### 2. Abstractive Summarization
- **Encoder-Decoder Models**: Learns to paraphrase and generate new text rather than copying original phrases.
- **Attention Mechanisms & Pointer Networks**: Balances between generating new words and copying salient phrases from the source.

### 3. Hybrid/Combined Approaches
- **Pointer-Generator Networks**: Combine extractive (copy) and abstractive (generate) behaviors.
- **Extract-Then-Abstract**: Select relevant portions first, then transform them into a concise summary.
- **Pretrained Models (BERT, GPT-like)**: Fine-tuning large language models for both extractive and abstractive tasks.

## Evaluation
- **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)**:
  - Compares n-grams with reference summaries.
  - Common metrics: ROUGE-1 (unigrams), ROUGE-2 (bigrams).
- **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**:
  - Precision-oriented measure comparing n-gram overlap between system and reference summaries.

## How to Use
1. **Pick Your Approach**: Choose extractive (simpler and robust) or abstractive (more human-like text).
2. **Leverage Pretrained Models**: Use BERT, GPT-based methods for quick implementation and domain adaptation.
3. **Evaluate Thoroughly**: Apply ROUGE or BLEU metrics for quality assessment; human evaluation remains crucial.
4. **Extend & Contribute**: Experiment with combined methods or new architectures—community contributions are encouraged!
