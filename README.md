Awesome Text Summarization
A quick reference guide for anyone looking to dive into the world of text summarization. This README outlines fundamental approaches, key methodologies, and available resources to help practitioners and researchers build effective summarization systems.

Motivation
Information Overload: Data is growing exponentially across industries (news, social media, etc.).
Goal: Generate concise, informative, and potentially domain-specific summaries to save time and aid in understanding.
Task Definition
Single/Multi-Document Summarization: Summaries can be derived from one or multiple sources.
Query-Focused Summarization: Summaries tailored to a user’s question or topic of interest.
Generic vs. Focused: Generic aims for a broad overview, while focused addresses specific details or differences.
Basic Approaches
Extractive
Graph-Based (e.g., TextRank): Uses graph structures (nodes = text units, edges = similarity) to rank sentence importance.
Feature-Based: Scores sentences based on features (position, TF, NE tags), then selects the top candidates.
Topic-Based: Relies on topic modeling (LSA, LDA) to identify key thematic sentences.
Neural Models: Uses deep learning (RNNs, transformers) to predict which sentences should appear in the summary.
Abstractive
Encoder-Decoder Models: Learns to paraphrase and generate new text rather than copying original phrases.
Attention Mechanisms & Pointer Networks: Balances between generating new words and copying salient phrases from the source.
Hybrid / Combined: Extract then rewrite, or switch between generation and copying to handle novel words.
Combination & Transfer Learning
Pointer-Generator Networks: Combine extractive (copy) and abstractive (generate) behaviors.
Extract-Then-Abstract: Select relevant portions first, then transform them into a concise summary.
Pretrained Models (BERT, GPT-like): Fine-tuning large language models for both extractive and abstractive tasks.
Evaluation
ROUGE (Recall-Oriented): Compares n-grams with reference summaries (commonly ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2).
BLEU (Precision-Oriented): Looks at how many matching n-grams appear in both the system summary and the reference.
Resources
Datasets: CNN/Daily Mail, Gigaword, Newsroom, etc.
Libraries: Gensim, pytextrank, TextTeaser, TensorFlow models, sumeval.
Articles & Papers: A wealth of blog posts and academic papers covering everything from fundamental to state-of-the-art methods.
How to Use
Pick Your Approach: Extractive (simpler and robust) or abstractive (more human-like text).
Leverage Pretrained Models: Consider BERT, GPT-based methods for quick wins and domain adaptation.
Evaluate Thoroughly: Use ROUGE or BLEU to gauge summary quality, but remember that human evaluation is often crucial.
Extend & Contribute: Try combining methods, or experiment with new architectures—pull requests are welcome!
